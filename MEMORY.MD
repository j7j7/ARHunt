# ARHunt Development Memory

This file tracks key changes made to the ARHunt project and development progress.

## Recent Changes (October 7, 2025)

### Fixed InstantDB Import Issue
**Problem**: The app was getting errors when trying to load InstantDB:
- `GET https://esm.sh/@instantdb/version@v0.22.6?target=es2022 net::ERR_ABORTED 500 (Internal Server Error)`
- `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: https://esm.sh/@instantdb/core@0.22.6`

**Solution**: Replaced ESM.sh dynamic import with Skypack CDN and proper initialization:

1. **Changed from dynamic import to static module loading**:
   - Before: `const { init, i, id } = await import('https://esm.sh/@instantdb/core@0.22.6');`
   - After: Added Skypack CDN script in `index.html` that makes InstantDB globally available

2. **Updated index.html**:
   - Added InstantDB import via Skypack CDN with proper ES module support
   - Added event-driven initialization to ensure InstantDB loads before main script

3. **Updated mind-hunt.js**:
   - Changed from async function with dynamic import to proper event-driven initialization
   - Added dual event listener system that waits for both DOM ready and InstantDB ready
   - Uses `window.InstantDB` instead of dynamic import

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html`: Added Skypack CDN script for InstantDB
- `mind-hunt.js`: Refactored initialization to use global InstantDB object

**Status**: Fixed and tested locally. Ready for GitHub Pages deployment.

## Project Architecture Notes

- **Database**: Uses InstantDB for real-time multiplayer features (discoveries notifications)
- **AR Framework**: MindAR + A-Frame for WebAR functionality
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- **Target Detection**: Requires `assets/targets/targets.mind` file compiled from MindAR
- **Assets Structure**: 
  - `assets/overlays/DA1.jpg` through `DA8.jpg` for target overlays
  - `assets/targets/targets.mind` for AR target recognition

## Recent Changes (October 7, 2025 - Session 2)

### Enhanced InstantDB Player Progress Tracking
**Enhancement**: Comprehensive player progress tracking and analytics system

**New Features Added**:
1. **Enhanced Database Schema**:
   - `gameSessions`: Track complete game sessions with real-time progress
   - `discoveries`: Detailed individual target discoveries with timing
   - `playerStats`: Player achievements and statistics across all games

2. **Real-time Session Management**:
   - Creates session when player starts game
   - Updates progress as each target is discovered
   - Records completion time and session duration
   - Tracks player statistics and achievements

3. **Comprehensive Data Tracking**:
   - Player name and unique session ID
   - Start time, completion time, and total duration
   - Real-time progress percentage (0-100%)
   - Individual target discovery timing and sequence
   - Player statistics: total games, completion rate, best times

**Database Schema Structure**:
- **gameSessions**: Overall session tracking with progress updates
- **discoveries**: Individual target finds with detailed timing
- **playerStats**: Cumulative player achievements and records

**Files Modified**:
- `instant.schema.ts`: Enhanced schema with comprehensive player tracking
- `mind-hunt.js`: Added session management and real-time progress updates
- `MEMORY.MD`: Updated with new features

**Key Functions Added**:
- `createGameSession()`: Initialize new game session
- `updateGameSession()`: Real-time progress updates
- `completeGameSession()`: Finalize session with completion data
- `updatePlayerStats()`: Track cumulative player achievements

### Simplified Overlay Implementation to Fix Rendering Issues
**Problem**: AR detection was working but overlay images weren't appearing visually on detected targets

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- Extensive debugging revealed AR detection was working perfectly
- Database logging, fireworks, and event handling all functional
- Issue was with overlay plane rendering due to overly complex setup

**Solution**: Simplified to match official MindAR example pattern:

1. **HTML Changes**:
   - Removed complex material attributes from overlay planes
   - Changed from `material="src: #asset; transparent: true; opacity: 1"` to simple `src="#asset"`
   - Standardized all positions to `position="0 0 0"` (official MindAR pattern)
   - Set standard dimensions: `height="0.552" width="1"`

2. **JavaScript Cleanup**:
   - Removed excessive overlay manipulation code that was forcing visibility/positioning
   - Removed test elements that were added for debugging
   - Simplified event handlers to focus on game logic, not overlay manipulation
   - Let MindAR handle overlay visibility automatically

**Implementation Now Follows Official Pattern**:
```html
<a-entity mindar-image-target="targetIndex: 0">
  <a-plane src="#da1" position="0 0 0" height="0.552" width="1" rotation="0 0 0"></a-plane>
</a-entity>
```

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html`: Simplified all 8 target overlay definitions
- `mind-hunt.js`: Removed overlay manipulation code, kept clean event handlers
- `MEMORY.MD`: Updated with solution details

## Recent Changes (October 7, 2025 - Session 3b)

### Fixed Camera Permission Interference Issue
**Critical Discovery**: The overlay rendering issue was likely caused by camera permission checking that interfered with MindAR's camera initialization.

**Problem**: 
- App was checking camera permissions by creating a stream and immediately stopping it
- This happened before MindAR tried to initialize its own camera access
- The stopped stream may have interfered with MindAR's ability to properly render overlays

**Solution**:
1. **Removed manual camera permission checking**: Let MindAR handle camera permissions directly
2. **Simplified AR startup**: Direct call to `startAR()` without pre-checking permissions
3. **Cleaned up overlay manipulation**: Removed excessive debugging and manipulation code
4. **Trust MindAR's built-in handling**: Let the library manage camera access and overlay visibility

**Files Modified**:
- `mind-hunt.js`: Removed `checkCameraPermissions()` function and its usage
- `mind-hunt.js`: Simplified startup flow to let MindAR handle everything
- `index.html`: Cleaned up test overlays from target-4

### Keep Camera Running Continuously 
**New Approach**: Instead of starting/stopping camera, keep it running but control game activation

**Changes Made**:
1. **AR container visible from start**: Removed `hidden` class from `ar-container` in HTML
2. **Start AR immediately**: AR system starts when scene loads, not when user clicks "Start"
3. **Game activation flag**: Added `gameActive` boolean to control target response
4. **Continuous camera**: Camera runs in background during name entry, overlays should initialize properly

**Flow Now**:
- Page loads → AR starts immediately → Camera active
- User enters name → Menu overlay still visible over camera feed
- User clicks "Start" → Menu hides, HUD shows, `gameActive = true`
- Targets now respond to detection events

**Files Modified**:
- `index.html`: Removed `hidden` from ar-container
- `mind-hunt.js`: Added gameActive flag and modified event handlers
- `mind-hunt.js`: AR starts on scene load instead of on button click

**Expected Result**: Overlays should now render properly since camera and AR system initialize fully before any interruption

## Current Issues to Watch
- Test overlay visibility with simplified implementation on actual devices
- Monitor if further adjustments needed for different target aspect ratios
- Future: May need to update target images or MindAR compilation if detection issues arise
- Monitor database performance with increased data collection
